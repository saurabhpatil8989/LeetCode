# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

# If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

# Example 1:
# Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
# Output: 5

# max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)
# Example 2:
# Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
# Output: 0

# In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.#
